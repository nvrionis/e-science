        <h5 align="justify"> 
        eScience is a cloud-based integrated service platform for big data analytics offered by GRNET and the associated ~okeanos IaaS.
        Currently the codenamed orka CLI and Web interfaces enable ~okeanos users to create and manage Hadoop 2.x (YARN) multi-node clusters in order to run their big data algorithms.
        Furthermore, a number of other pre-cooked images with Hadoop-centered software is available for faster, easier and friendlier development: Ecosystem (Pig, Hive, HBase, Oozie, Flume, Spark), Cloudera, Hue.
        Researchers, university students and teachers can fully exploit the MapReduce (as well as others) programming paradigm without wasting time and resources in hardware, software setup, etc.
        In order to aid them in everyday research work, VM images with a range of installed software (wiki, project management, portal setup, teleconference and digital repositories) can also be deployed through the orka VRE (Virtual Research Environment) options. </h5>
