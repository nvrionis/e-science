## Deploy Orka Server
A collection of python and ansible scripts have been assembled in `<project_root>/deploy` to facilitate the deployment of a specific version of the application.  
The environment consists of a standalone Virtual Machine running a release configuration with the Nginx-uWSGI-Postgres stack, serving the application from a public IP.
